// Investigate workflow.
//
// Triggered from .github/workflows/investigate.yml when a maintainer
// adds `bot:repro` to an issue (or via workflow_dispatch on retry).
// Drives a four-stage pipeline over an EmDash checkout:
//
//   1. Classify -- decide kind/area/requiresBrowser. Bail early for
//      non-bug kinds.
//   2. Reproduce -- run one of three sub-skills based on area:
//      repro-api (no browser), repro-admin (agent-browser + dev bypass),
//      or repro-public (agent-browser against the public site). Skips
//      cleanly when the bug requires external data or production-only
//      conditions.
//   3. Diagnose -- read the code paths that explain the reproduction
//      and rate confidence.
//   4. Verify -- decide whether the diagnosed behaviour is actually a
//      bug or intended. Gates the fix stage.
//   5. Fix -- runs when verify=='bug', diagnose.confidence!='low', and
//      diagnose.fixApproach!='needs-design-decision'. Runs on a cheaper
//      model in its own session (the reasoning is already done; it
//      implements diagnose's proposedFix). Writes the change, runs the
//      reproduce test, the broader package tests, typecheck, lint,
//      format. Stages but does not commit -- the YAML orchestrator does.
//
// Every stage uses session.skill() with a valibot result schema. The
// orchestrator (the GH Actions workflow) reads the final JSON via jq
// and decides which label to apply and what to comment.
//
// The agent uses local() so its bash tool has real pnpm/git/gh/node/
// agent-browser on $PATH. AGENT_GH_TOKEN (read-only) is the only token
// passed into the sandbox env. The orchestrator's app token lives in
// the workflow YAML and never crosses into this agent process.
