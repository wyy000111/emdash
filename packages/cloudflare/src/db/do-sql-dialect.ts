/**
 * Kysely dialect for the production Durable Object SQL database.
 *
 * Proxies queries to an `EmDashDB` stub via RPC. Two properties matter for
 * latency and correctness:
 *
 *   1. **One stub, reused.** The dialect resolves a single DO stub lazily (on
 *      the first query, inside a request's I/O context) and reuses it for every
 *      query. Resolving a fresh stub per query is the main source of D1-style
 *      per-query round-trip overhead; the request-scoped factory in `do-sql.ts`
 *      gives each request its own dialect, so this is "one stub per request".
 *
 *   2. **No interactive transactions**, matching D1 (kysely-d1). The driver
 *      rejects `beginTransaction` with the message EmDash's `withTransaction`
 *      helper probes for, so transaction callbacks degrade to direct execution
 *      against the primary-routed connection — the same atomicity profile the
 *      codebase already runs under on D1.
