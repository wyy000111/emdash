/**
 * EmDash Request Context
 *
 * Uses AsyncLocalStorage to provide request-scoped state to query functions
 * without requiring explicit parameter passing. The middleware wraps next()
 * in als.run(), making the context available to all code during rendering.
 *
 * Middleware always wraps each request in a context so per-request
 * metrics (db.*, cache.*) can be surfaced via Server-Timing. The cost is
 * one ALS frame per request — sub-microsecond, negligible compared to
 * any real work.
 *
 * The AsyncLocalStorage instance is stored on globalThis with a Symbol key
 * to guarantee a singleton even when bundlers duplicate this module across
 * code-split chunks. Without this, Rollup/Vite may inline the module into
 * multiple chunks (e.g. middleware and page components), each with its own
 * ALS instance — breaking request-scoped state propagation.
