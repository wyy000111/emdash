/**
 * Programmatic publish API.
 *
 * Pure-ish core of the publish pipeline: given an already-fetched tarball
 * checksum, an extracted manifest, an authenticated `PublishingClient`, and
 * the URL the bytes are hosted at, this writes the profile (if missing) and
 * release records to the publisher's atproto repo.
 *
 * Splits cleanly from the CLI command so tests can run it against a mock
 * `PublishingClient` without going through OAuth, the filesystem credentials
 * store, or an HTTP fetch for the tarball.
 *
 * Atomicity
 * ---------
 *
 * Profile bootstrap + release create happen in a single atproto
 * `applyWrites` commit, so a network blip mid-publish can't leave a profile
 * with no releases (or vice versa). FAIR specifies version-record
 * immutability; we refuse to overwrite an existing release at
 * `<slug>:<version>` unless `allowOverwrite: true` is set.
 *
 * Validation
 * ----------
 *
 * Slug (derived from `manifest.id`) and version are validated against the
 * registry-lexicon constraints before any network round-trip, so the user
 * gets a clear `PublishError` with the offending value rather than a generic
 * `InvalidRequest` from the PDS. Profile-bootstrap fields (license, security
 * contact) are also validated up-front for the same reason.
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *
 *   - `DEPRECATED_CAPABILITY`: the manifest declares one of the deprecated
 *     capability names. Bundle warns; publish refuses.
 *   - `INVALID_SLUG` / `INVALID_VERSION`: the derived slug or the manifest
 *     version doesn't match the lexicon constraints.
 *   - `PROFILE_BOOTSTRAP_MISSING_FIELD`: first publish without the required
 *     `license` and `securityEmail`/`securityUrl`.
 *   - `RELEASE_ALREADY_PUBLISHED`: the release record at `<slug>:<version>`
 *     already exists in the repo. Pass `allowOverwrite: true` to opt in to
 *     overwriting (aggregators may flag the change as a takedown).
