/**
 * Local-only types for the bundling pipeline.
 *
 * The cross-package manifest contract (capabilities, manifest shape, hook
 * entries, etc.) lives in `@emdash-cms/plugin-types` and is re-exported from
 * here for convenience so the bundling internals only need one import.
 *
 * The only type that doesn't go upstream is `ResolvedPlugin`: it's the
 * loose internal shape the bundler reads from a user plugin's compiled
 * `createPlugin()` / descriptor-factory output. Core has its own canonical,
 * tightly-typed `ResolvedPlugin` that we don't want to depend on (it pulls
 * in Astro / blocks / schema). Both sides exist in service of the same
 * manifest contract; they don't need to share the runtime shape.
