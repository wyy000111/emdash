Fixes `SQLITE_CORRUPT_VTAB` (`database disk image is malformed`) when editing or publishing content on collections that have search enabled, and on restore-from-trash, permanent-delete, and edit-while-trashed flows.

The FTS5 sync triggers used the contentless-table form (`DELETE FROM fts WHERE rowid = OLD.rowid`) on what is actually an external-content FTS5 table. After an UPDATE on `ec_<collection>`, FTS5 then read NEW column values from the (already updated) content table while trying to remove OLD tokens from the inverted index, drifting the index out of sync until SQLite refused further reads. Rewrites the triggers to use the documented external-content-safe `INSERT INTO fts(fts, rowid, ...) VALUES('delete', OLD.rowid, OLD.col1, ...)` pattern, gated on `OLD.deleted_at IS NULL` so we don't try to remove rows that were never indexed (which would itself raise `SQLITE_CORRUPT_VTAB` on restore-from-trash and permanent-delete).

Adds migration `039_fix_fts5_triggers` that rebuilds the FTS index for every search-enabled collection on upgrade, replacing the broken triggers and recovering from any latent index corruption left behind by earlier mutations. The migration runs once at startup before the first request can hit the affected paths, so upgrading sites get the fix on their next deploy without depending on a search-endpoint visit to trigger lazy auto-repair.
